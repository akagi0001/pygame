Api changes and other compatibility notes from previous version

cocos 0.6.4
-----------

This is the first release supporting pyglet 1.3+

Imports in cocos library are more specific, so user code that were doing
``from cocos.somemodule import *`` may fail to find some symbols.
To fix that user code, add explicit exports as needed.

MapColliders classes changed API to be more useful and clear. 
  - MapColliders moved to his own module, 'mapcolliders'.
  - RectMapCollider was renamed to RectMapWithPropsCollider.
  - The new RectMapCollider handles a simpler collision case, when all tiles
    are solid: now no need to set cells properties to signal a cell border should
    not be walked over.
  - TmxObjectMapCollider now handles AABB collision with any TmxObject that
    can be loaded.

Rect.intersects() now it only intersects iff some interior points overlaps 

Removed Scene methods push_all_handlers() and remove_all_handlers()

In ScrollingManager two methods had been renamed, the old name still valid but
will be removed in future:
 - pixel_from_screen() -> screen_to_world()
 - pixel_to_screen() -> world_to_screen()
